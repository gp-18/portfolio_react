        I'm Parth Gupta, A student at Government Engineering College, Modasa, and I'm now enrolled in my pre-final year of the B.Tech. CSE programme. I became interested in computer science during my school years. I'm curious about using C++ to solve problems. I have a lot of passion for app and website development.I'm interested in learning more about big data, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning. I'm a student who also wants to expand on the fundamentals of computer science. In college, I participated in several coding and technical challenges, hackathons, and open source projects.
